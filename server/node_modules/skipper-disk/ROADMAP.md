## Roadmap

Our short-to-medium-term roadmap items, in order of descending priority:

_(feel free to suggest things)_

 Feature                                                  | Owner                                                                            | Details
 :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------
  N/A                  | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | No additional features are planned at this time (`skipper-disk`-specific stuff, that is)


#### Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.  We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.
