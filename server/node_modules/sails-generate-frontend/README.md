# sails-generate-frontend

Default generator for frontend code files in new Sails projects. Creates the default contents of the `assets/` folder when you run `sails new` on the command-line.  Also creates a subset of the boilerplate Grunt task files (in `tasks/`); specifically, the files make up the conventional asset pipeline.

> You can read more about how all that works in [docs/](./docs/overview.md).
