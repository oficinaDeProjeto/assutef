## Roadmap

Our short-to-medium-term roadmap items, in order of descending priority:

#### Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.
We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with
reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.

 Feature                                         | Owner                                              | Details
 :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------
 Support custom Join Table names                 | [@devinivy](https://github.com/devinivy)           | Allow the name of the generated join table to be customized. See [#20](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline-schema/issues/20)
