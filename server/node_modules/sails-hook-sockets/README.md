`sockets` hook for Sails v0.11

## Status

> ##### Stability: [2](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/stability-index.md) - Stable


## Purpose

This hook's responsibilities are:

#### When initialized...
+ fire up socket.io server
+ listen for connect / disconnect events
  + listen for get/post/put/delete/patch events
    + create bare-bones request and response contexts, then pass them to the core interpreter in Sails to be routed on the fly.

#### Bind "shadow" routes...

###### `before`
N/A

###### `after`

+ `GET __getcookie`


#### Expose on the `sails` app object:

+ `sails.sockets.*` (see reference documentationÂ for sails.sockets on sailsjs.org for full list of exposed methods)

## FAQ

> If you have a question that isn't covered here, please feel free to send a PR adding it to this section.

#### What is this?

This repo contains a hook, one of the building blocks Sails is made out of.

#### What version of Sails is this for?

This hook is a dependency of Sails core as of v0.11.

#### Does this hook use Socket.io v1.0?

Yes.

#### Are there changes?

Yes, see the [v0.11 migration guide](http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/Upgrading). You probably won't need to change anything unless you were extensively using the old Socket.io v0.9 configuration.


## Running the tests

First, clone this repo, cd into it, and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets.git
cd sails-hook-sockets
npm install
```

#### Run them all

To run all the tests, start a local redis server on port 6380 and then run the tests using mocha:

```sh
redis-server --port 6380
npm test
```


#### Run only certain tests

Alternatively, you can run a particular set of tests with:

```sh
node ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha -g 'without session'
```

> (this may be useful if you don't want to wait for all the tests to run, or e.g. if you aren't able to install a redis server locally.  However please make sure all the tests pass before submitting a PR.)
